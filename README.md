library
=======

Keep track of what books you own by organizing a list, this uses firebase to store the book titles, and ISBN's, and openlibrary for the img src URLS.

Simply Put, copy index.html into your hosting provider, and update the FB variable. And start adding books, if you have a list of books, convert them to JSON format and import them into firebase.

I'll post the layout details when more complete.
