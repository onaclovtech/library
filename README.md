library
=======

Keep track of what books you own by organizing a list, this uses firebase to store the book titles, and ISBN's, and openlibrary for the img src URLS.

Simply Put, copy index.html into your hosting provider, and update the FB variable. And start adding books, if you have a list of books, convert them to JSON format and import them into firebase. In it's current form index.html is designed for you to have an "all books" object, and youre specific location, so that you can break it up (in my case by family).

Readonly doesnt allow adding/removing of books, so you can "share" this link with trusted people and they can see what books you have if necessary.

I'll post the layout details when more complete.
